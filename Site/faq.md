##How do I get Nurevam to join my server?
>Make sure you have the `Manage Server` permission, log in on the website with your discord account and you will see a list of the servers that you have the `Manage Server` permission for.
Select the server you want Nurevam to join.

##How can I enable the plugins?
>Select the plugin you want to run and confirm that you want to enable it.

##Why did a command not working?
>Please make sure you have the respective plugin enabled. It may ask for the roles, permissions etc, also checked if this command is a subcommand which you will need to use the chain command.

##What is the subcommand?
>The subcommand comes after a main command. For example: role from mod plugin or clean as well are subcommands, so you would have to say !role add @person role_name

>If i write `!clean`, it will just clean all bot messages, however if i write `!clean all` it will clean all message, including user messages. Role does the same thing with add/remove.

>Bascially, it is just `<Main command> <subcommand>`

##What is my profile?
>Your profile is a global setting for all servers with Nurevam. If you, for example, have a MAL profile and enter your username on the website, you don't have to write down `!mal <username>`, but instead just `!mal` and the bot will do the work for you!

##Why are there so many permissions?
>It is entirely up to you, which permissions you give. I included all permission, so you can pick. I would recommend leaving the `manage message` permission checked, so it can delete your and it's own messages (with the `clean` command).

##What is this log plugin?
>The log plugin will keep you updated on what happens to the server. For example: Did a user delete a message, change his avatar, etc.
>This is, so that you can stay informed. Normally, this is for admins/mods who want to be kept informed and not confused about what happens.(I kinda don't like the edit/delete message, it is the user's privacy, right...)
